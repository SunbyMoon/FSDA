## Pre-process
Use the preprocess.sh script in the preprocess directory to create the required files for prediction. Based on the size of the sample and reference, this can take hours.

Usage:
./preprocess.sh [sample_dir] [ref_dir] [prep_dir]

sample_dir is the the directory containing the .bam and the .bai files for the sample cfDNA data.
ref_dir is the the directory containing the .bam and the .bai files for the reference cfDNA data.
prep_dir is the the directory where the script puts the created files inside.

## Prediction
The script predict_region.sh in the directory prediction can be used to predict the copy number of a region. The test sample and the reference sample locations and the test sample's admixture ratio are set inside the script. The script usage is as follows:

./predict_region.sh [sample_dir] [ref_dir] [prep_dir] [chr] [begin] [end] [ks_threshold] [neighbours_threshold] [fraction] 

sample_dir is the the directory containing the .bam and the .bai files for the sample cfDNA data.
ref_dir is the the directory containing the .bam and the .bai files for the reference cfDNA data.
prep_dir is the the directory containing the files created in the pre-process.
chr is the chromosome of the target region
begin is the beginning position of the target region
end is the end position of the target region
ks_threshold is the threshold for control similarity
neighbours_threshold is the threshold for the required minimum number of neighbours
fetal_fraction is the fraction of the cfDNA in the sample that is fetal origin

example:
./predict_region.sh ~/sample_dir ~/ref_dir ~/prep_dir chr3 10000000 11000000 0.002 5 0.13
